**As a** User,
**I need** a home page that mentions the purpose and has one clickable button
**So that** whoever clicks on the home page knows "the GiftLink application connects users who wish to give away household items they no longer need with users who enjoy recycling and prefer to find free household items to match their tastes rather than purchasing new ones" and the clickable button leads to household items listings page. 

### Details and Assumptions
*The home page will give a concise explanation of GiftLink's core purpose: connect givers and seekers of free household items.
*The single clickable link directs new users to a listings page.
*For users that want to declutter and those interested in obtaining free, recycled goods.

### Acceptance Criteria

gherkin
 **Given** user navigates to the GiftLink home page
 **When** the user clicks the "Get Started" button
 **Then** the user should be redirected to the listings page
